Web programming assignment
In our homework, we compiled the 5 most beautiful places in  to travel in Ankara province and turned them into a website. We has also used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MYSQL in this project . We have used various sources on the internet.

In our project, we often used images, description texts and maps, and created a main menu for user convenience, adding our 5 favorite places and contact menu here. In our Contact menu, we have linked the comment section to Mysql.

First, we created the bone structure of our site with HTML and added content. We then formatted the content we entered using JS and CSS. We didn't use a separate file for CSS, we wrote it on top of our HTML pages. Last time, we connected to MYSQL using PHP and created a database. In this way, we can see people who want to contact us or comment on our website.

For the most accurate view of our website, the zoom should be 67%.
